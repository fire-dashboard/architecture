=== redux-persist is currently not maintained

https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist[redux-persist] is a library that we use to continuously persist and to load persisted state. It is used by many but no commits are made and no pull-requests are accepted. This dependency may break in the future.

We currently take this risk because the library is really convenient. It is also decoupled from the actual redux state management. It hooks into it at one central place. That means that the cost of replacing it is not increasing over time.

We will thus continue to use it until an actual problem emerges.
